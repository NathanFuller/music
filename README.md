I'm gonna put music here

## contents
This is mostly going to be guitar chords, at least to start with. I like to
play music with my family. I think it would be nice to have a place where I can
write out the chords for songs we like to play and share them, etc.

Mostly covers. We don't have any originals at the time of writing.


## formatting
To start off with, I'm thinking plaintext will be easiest for the purposes I
have in mind. If anyone is aware of a markup/down that's really nice for guitar
chords, please do let me know.


## legal stuff
To the extent that any of this is my work, CC0 applies. Almost everything will
probably be :copyright: somebody else. I'll do my best to attribute it. Don't
make any money off work in this repo without verifying that someone else isn't
going to come after you. I won't come after you, but I accept no responsibility
in case someone else does.
