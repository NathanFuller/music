[Verse]

 

Em                            C     Am
 Have you got colour in your cheeks?

Am                                        Em
 Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the type

                         Em
that sticks around like summat in your teeth?

                C             Am
Are there some aces up your sleeve?

                                 Em
Have you no idea that you're in deep?

                           Em
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week

          C             Am
How many secrets can you keep?

                                    Em
Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow

      Em
And I play it on repeat

C         Am
 Until I fall asleep

                       B
Spilling drinks on my settee

 
 

[Pre-Chorus]
 

      C
Do I wanna know

         Am
if this feeling flows both ways?

        Em
Sad to see you go

          Em
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay

      C
Baby we both know

          Am
That the nights were mainly made

             Em                               Em
for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

 
 

[Chorus]
 

                  Em
Crawlin' back to you

                C       Am
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few

             Em
Cos I always do

          Em             C         Am
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new

                     Em
Now I've thought it through

                  Em
Crawlin' back to you

 
 

[Verse]
 

                    C    Am
So have you got the guts?

                                    Em
Been wondering if your hearts still open

                   Em
And if so I wanna know what time it shuts

C              Am
 Simmer down and pucker up

 
I'm sorry to interrupt

     Em
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp

             C        Am
Of trying to kiss you

                              Em
I don't know if you feel the same as I do

               C        Am
But we could be together

              B
if you wanted to

 
 

[Pre-Chorus]
 

      C
Do I wanna know

         Am
if this feeling flows both ways?

        Em
Sad to see you go

          Em
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay

      C
Baby we both know

          Am
That the nights were mainly made

             Em                               Em
for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

 
 

[Chorus]
 

                  Em
Crawlin' back to you

                C       Am
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few

             Em
Cos I always do

          Em             C         Am
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new

                     Em
Now I've thought it through

                  Em
Crawlin' back to you

 
 

[Pre-Chorus]
 

      C
Do I wanna know

         Am
if this feeling flows both ways?

        Em
Sad to see you go

          Em
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay

      C
Baby we both know

          Am
That the nights were mainly made

             Em                               Em
for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

 
      C
Do I wanna know

                Am
Too busy being yours to fall

        Em
Sad to see you go

                 D
Ever thought of calling darling?

      C
Do I wanna know

                Am             Em
Do you want me crawling back to you?
