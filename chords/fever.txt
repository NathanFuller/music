Am                              Dm                    Am
Never know how much I love you, never know how much I care

Am                                        E                       Am
When you put your arms around me, I get a fever that's so hard to bear

            Am                       Dm                     Am
You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight

Am                     E                     Am
Fever! In the morning, fever all through the night
 
[Verse 2]
 
Am                         Dm                 Am
Sun lights up the daytime, moon lights up the night

Am                                        E                        Am
I light up when you call my name, and you know I'm gonna treat you right
            Am                       Dm                     Am
You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight

Am                     E                     Am
Fever! In the morning, fever all through the night

 
 
[Bridge]
 
Am                         Dm                Am
Everybody's got the fever, that is something you all know

Am                            E                   Am
Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago
