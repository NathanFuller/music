            Am                       Dm                     Am
You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight

Am                     E                     Am
Fever! In the morning, fever all through the night

I light up when you call my name, and you know I'm gonna treat you right
            Am                       Dm                     Am
You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight

Am                     E                     Am
Fever! In the morning, fever all through the night

Am                         Dm                Am
Everybody's got the fever, that is something you all know

Am                            E                   Am
Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago
